To run our actual program, simply enter "ruby dslRun.rb" into the command line. This will properly bring up the list of options that the user can choose between. 

To run our tests, enter "ruby DSLTester.rb" into the command line. This will run all of our tests,
and it will not run our actual program as requested.
